<!-- # SQL DATETIME Functions -->

## Introduction

DATETIME functions in SQL are essential for handling date and time values within databases. They provide the ability to manipulate, format, and calculate dates and times, which is crucial for many data analysis tasks.

## Conceptual Explanation

### 1. CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIME, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

- `CURRENT_DATE` returns the current date.
- `CURRENT_TIME` returns the current time with the time zone.
- `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` returns the current date and time with the time zone.

### 2. AGE

The `AGE` function calculates the age (difference) between two dates.

### 3. EXTRACT

The `EXTRACT` function retrieves specific parts from a date or time value (like day, month, year, etc.).

## Syntax and Usage

### CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIME, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

```sql
SELECT CURRENT_DATE;
SELECT CURRENT_TIME;
SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```

### AGE

```sql
SELECT AGE(timestamp1, timestamp2);
```

### EXTRACT

```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(unit FROM date);
```

## Practical Examples

### CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIME, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

```sql
-- Example: Retrieve the current date, time, and timestamp
SELECT CURRENT_DATE;
SELECT CURRENT_TIME;
SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```

### AGE

```sql
-- Example: Calculate the age between two dates
SELECT age('2014-04-25', '2014-01-01');
-- Example: Calculate the time taken for an order to ship
SELECT order_line, order_date, ship_date, 
       AGE(ship_date, order_date) AS time_taken
FROM sales
ORDER BY time_taken DESC;
```

### EXTRACT

```sql
-- Example: Extract day from a date
SELECT EXTRACT(day FROM '2014-04-25');
-- Example: Extract minute from time
SELECT EXTRACT(minute FROM '08:44:21');
-- Example: Calculate the epoch time difference between shipping and order dates
SELECT order_line, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ship_date - order_date))
FROM sales;
```

## Summary

Understanding DATETIME functions in SQL is crucial for effective data manipulation and analysis, especially when dealing with time-sensitive data. These functions enable precise date and time calculations, formatting, and extraction, enhancing the capabilities of SQL queries.
