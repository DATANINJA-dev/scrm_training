<!-- # SQL Ranking Window Functions Detailed Guide -->

In SQL, ranking window functions are essential for analytics and reporting where there is a need to assign ranks to rows based on their values. They are particularly powerful when used in conjunction with the `OVER()` clause, which defines the partitioning and ordering of the rows for the ranking operation.

## ROW_NUMBER()

The `ROW_NUMBER()` function assigns a unique number to each row starting from 1 for the first row in each partition. This ranking is reset for each partition.

### Theoretical Example:

Imagine we have a sales table and we want to rank sales employees based on their individual sales performance in each region.

```sql
SELECT 
  EmployeeID,
  Region,
  SalesAmount,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Region ORDER BY SalesAmount DESC) AS Rank
FROM 
  SalesRecords;
```

This will assign a unique rank to each sales employee within each region based on the total sales amount, with the highest sales getting the number 1.

## RANK()

The `RANK()` function assigns a rank to each row within a partition with the same rank for tie values. The subsequent rank after a tie will be incremented based on the total number of tied ranks.

### Theoretical Example:

Using the same sales table, if we want to rank sales employees but give the same rank to employees with the same sales amount, we would use `RANK()`.

```sql
SELECT 
  EmployeeID,
  Region,
  SalesAmount,
  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Region ORDER BY SalesAmount DESC) AS Rank
FROM 
  SalesRecords;
```

## DENSE_RANK()

The `DENSE_RANK()` function is similar to `RANK()`, but it doesn't skip ranks after ties. After a tie, the next rank will be the next consecutive integer.

### Theoretical Example:

In the sales table, if two employees in the same region have the same sales amount and we want to ensure no ranks are skipped after a tie:

```sql
SELECT 
  EmployeeID,
  Region,
  SalesAmount,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Region ORDER BY SalesAmount DESC) AS DenseRank
FROM 
  SalesRecords;
```

## PERCENT_RANK()

The `PERCENT_RANK()` function computes the rank of a row as a percentage of the number of rows in the partition.

### Theoretical Example:

To understand the relative standing of each employee within their region:

```sql
SELECT 
  EmployeeID,
  Region,
  SalesAmount,
  PERCENT_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Region ORDER BY SalesAmount DESC) AS PercentRank
FROM 
  SalesRecords;
```

## NTILE()

The `NTILE()` function divides the sorted result set into a specified number of roughly equal parts.

### Theoretical Example:

If we want to divide the employees into quartiles based on their sales within each region:

```sql
SELECT 
  EmployeeID,
  Region,
  SalesAmount,
  NTILE(4) OVER (PARTITION BY Region ORDER BY SalesAmount DESC) AS Quartile
FROM 
  SalesRecords;
```

## Summary

Ranking functions are highly beneficial for identifying and categorizing data based on their ordinal rank within a partition. They are indispensable for comparative analysis and report generation in SQL. These functions are supported across various SQL databases, making them universally useful for data analysts and developers.

By understanding these functions and practicing with real or theoretical data, students will be able to apply these functions to address complex data retrieval requirements.
