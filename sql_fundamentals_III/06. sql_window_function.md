Window functions in SQL are used to perform calculations across a set of rows that are related to the current row. Unlike regular aggregate functions, window functions do not collapse the rows into a single output row; they preserve the individual rows. This allows us to add aggregated data into queries without using `GROUP BY`. Window functions are ideal for tasks such as running totals, moving averages, and cumulative statistics.

## Types of Window Functions

There are three primary types of window functions:

### 1. Aggregate Window Functions

These are regular aggregate functions, but when used with over clause, they act over a set of rows related to the current row while still keeping separate rows. Common aggregate window functions include:
- `AVG()`: Calculates the average of a set of values.
- `MAX()`: Gets the maximum value from a set of values.
- `MIN()`: Gets the minimum value from a set of values.
- `SUM()`: Calculates the sum of a set of values.
- `COUNT()`: Counts the number of values in a set.

### 2. Ranking Window Functions

Ranking functions assign a rank to each row within a partition of a result set. The most common ranking functions are:
- `ROW_NUMBER()`: Assigns a unique sequential integer to rows within a partition of a result set, starting at 1 for the first row in each partition.
- `RANK()`: Assigns a rank to each row within a partition of a result set, with gaps in the ranking for tied values.
- `DENSE_RANK()`: Similar to `RANK()`, but without gaps in the ranking for tied values.
- `PERCENT_RANK()`: Calculates the relative rank of a row within a partition of a result set.
- `NTILE()`: Distributes the rows in an ordered partition into a specified number of groups and assigns a group number to each row.

### 3. Value Window Functions

Value functions perform calculations related to the values in a dataset, often comparing rows to preceding or following rows. These include:
- `LAG()`: Accesses data from a previous row in the same result set without the use of a self-join.
- `LEAD()`: Accesses data from a subsequent row in the same result set without the use of a self-join.
- `FIRST_VALUE()`: Gets the first value in an ordered set of values.
- `LAST_VALUE()`: Gets the last value in an ordered set of values.
- `NTH_VALUE()`: Gets the nth value in an ordered set of values.

## Using Window Functions

To use window functions, you typically define the window using the `OVER()` clause to specify how the rows are divided into partitions or windows and how they are ordered. Here's the general syntax:

```sql
WINDOW_FUNCTION_NAME() OVER ( [PARTITION BY partition_expression] [ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC|DESC]] )
```

Where:
- `WINDOW_FUNCTION_NAME` is the name of the window function.
- `PARTITION BY partition_expression` divides the result set into partitions where the window function is applied. If not specified, the entire result set is treated as a single partition.
- `ORDER BY sort_expression` specifies the logical order within each partition.

## Example Usage

```sql
-- Calculate running total sales for each product
SELECT 
  ProductID,
  OrderDate,
  SalesAmount,
  SUM(SalesAmount) OVER (PARTITION BY ProductID ORDER BY OrderDate) AS RunningTotal
FROM Sales;
```

In the example above, we're using `SUM()` as a window function to calculate a running total of `SalesAmount` for each `ProductID` over the order of `OrderDate`.

## Summary

Window functions are a powerful feature in SQL that allow for sophisticated calculations and analyses. They can simplify queries that would otherwise be complex and increase performance by reducing the need for multiple queries or complex joins.
