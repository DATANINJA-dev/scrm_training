<!-- # SQL Value Window Functions Detailed Guide -->

Value window functions are a subset of window functions in SQL that operate on the values of the rows in a window. These functions are particularly useful for comparing values across different rows without changing the rows' order or number.

## LAG()

The `LAG()` function is used to access data from a previous row in the result set without using a self-join. It's useful for comparing the current row with a row that comes before it.

### Theoretical Example:

To compare the sales amount of the current month with the previous month for each employee:

```sql
SELECT 
  EmployeeID,
  SaleMonth,
  SalesAmount,
  LAG(SalesAmount, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY EmployeeID ORDER BY SaleMonth) AS PreviousMonthSales
FROM 
  MonthlySales;
```

## LEAD()

The `LEAD()` function is used to access data from a subsequent row in the result set without using a self-join. It's useful for comparing the current row with a row that follows it.

### Theoretical Example:

To compare the sales amount of the current month with the next month for each employee:

```sql
SELECT 
  EmployeeID,
  SaleMonth,
  SalesAmount,
  LEAD(SalesAmount, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY EmployeeID ORDER BY SaleMonth) AS NextMonthSales
FROM 
  MonthlySales;
```

## FIRST_VALUE()

The `FIRST_VALUE()` function is used to access the first value in an ordered set of values in each partition.

### Theoretical Example:

To identify the first sale amount achieved by an employee in a fiscal year:

```sql
SELECT 
  EmployeeID,
  SaleMonth,
  SalesAmount,
  FIRST_VALUE(SalesAmount) OVER (PARTITION BY EmployeeID ORDER BY SaleMonth) AS FirstSaleAmount
FROM 
  MonthlySales;
```

## LAST_VALUE()

The `LAST_VALUE()` function is used to access the last value in an ordered set of values in each partition. To get the actual last value, one must use the `ROWS BETWEEN` clause to look at all rows in the partition.

### Theoretical Example:

To identify the last sale amount achieved by an employee in a fiscal year:

```sql
SELECT 
  EmployeeID,
  SaleMonth,
  SalesAmount,
  LAST_VALUE(SalesAmount) OVER (PARTITION BY EmployeeID ORDER BY SaleMonth 
                                RANGE BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS LastSaleAmount
FROM 
  MonthlySales;
```

## NTH_VALUE()

The `NTH_VALUE()` function is used to access the nth value in an ordered set of values in each partition.

### Theoretical Example:

To find the third highest sale amount for an employee in a fiscal year:

```sql
SELECT 
  EmployeeID,
  SaleMonth,
  SalesAmount,
  NTH_VALUE(SalesAmount, 3) OVER (PARTITION BY EmployeeID ORDER BY SalesAmount DESC) AS ThirdHighestSale
FROM 
  MonthlySales;
```

## Summary

Value window functions provide a means to perform calculations across related rows in a table. They are essential for analyzing sequences, trends, and making row-to-row comparisons in data sets. With the use of these functions, complex tasks such as calculating differences between consecutive rows or accessing data beyond the current row become straightforward.
