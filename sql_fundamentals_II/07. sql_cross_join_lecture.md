<!-- # CROSS JOIN in SQL -->

## Introduction

CROSS JOIN in SQL, also known as CARTESIAN JOIN, is used to combine each row from one table with every row from another table. This join is essential in scenarios where you need to create a Cartesian product of two sets of data.

## Conceptual Explanation

In SQL, a CROSS JOIN is unique as it does not require a condition to join two tables. Instead, it combines every row of one table with every row of another, resulting in a Cartesian product. This is particularly useful for scenarios where you need to pair each item from one dataset with every item from another dataset.

### Types of Joins

- **INNER JOIN**: Returns records with matching values in both tables.
- **LEFT OUTER JOIN (LEFT JOIN)**: Returns all records from the left table and matched records from the right table.
- **RIGHT OUTER JOIN (RIGHT JOIN)**: Returns all records from the right table and matched records from the left table.
- **FULL OUTER JOIN (FULL JOIN)**: Combines results of both left and right outer joins.
- **CROSS JOIN (CARTESIAN JOIN)**: Creates a Cartesian product of rows from two tables.

## Syntax and Usage

The basic syntax for a CROSS JOIN in SQL is:

```sql
SELECT table1.column1, table2.column2...
FROM table1, table2;
```

This syntax will combine every row from `table1` with every row from `table2`.

## Practical Examples

Consider two tables: `year_values` and `month_values`. The following SQL query demonstrates how to use a CROSS JOIN:

```sql
SELECT a.YYYY, b.MM
FROM year_values AS a, month_values AS b
ORDER BY a.YYYY, b.MM;
```

In this example, the CROSS JOIN will combine each year value from `year_values` with each month value from `month_values`, ordered by year and month.

## Summary

The CROSS JOIN in SQL is a powerful tool for generating combinations of data from two different tables. It is particularly useful for scenarios that require the pairing of each element from one dataset with every element from another, such as in certain types of data analysis or reporting.
