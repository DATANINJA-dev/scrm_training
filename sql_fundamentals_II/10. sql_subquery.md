<!-- # SQL Subqueries -->

## Introduction

A subquery in SQL is a query nested inside another query. Subqueries can be used in various parts of a query, including the WHERE clause, the FROM clause, and the SELECT clause. They are powerful tools for performing complex data retrieval tasks.

## Conceptual Explanation

Subqueries allow for more dynamic and flexible SQL queries. They enable a query to be constructed based on the results of another query, often allowing for more sophisticated data analysis and retrieval.

### Subquery in WHERE

A subquery within the WHERE clause can filter data based on the result of another query.

### Subquery in FROM

A subquery within the FROM clause can be used to create a temporary table from which the main query can retrieve data.

### Subquery in SELECT

A subquery within the SELECT clause can return a single value used in a column of the main query.

## Syntax and Usage

The general syntax for a subquery is:

```sql
SELECT column_name1
FROM table_name1
WHERE column_name2 [Comparison Operator]
(SELECT column_name3
 FROM table_name2
 WHERE condition);
```

## Practical Examples

1. **Subquery in WHERE**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM sales
   WHERE customer_ID IN
   (SELECT DISTINCT customer_id
    FROM customer WHERE age > 60);
   ```

2. **Subquery in FROM**:
   ```sql
   SELECT a.product_id, a.product_name, a.category, b.quantity
   FROM product AS a
   LEFT JOIN (SELECT product_id, SUM(quantity) AS quantity
              FROM sales GROUP BY product_id) AS b
   ON a.product_id = b.product_id
   ORDER BY b.quantity DESC;
   ```

3. **Subquery in SELECT**:
   ```sql
   SELECT customer_id, order_line,
          (SELECT customer_name
           FROM customer
           WHERE sales.customer_id = customer.customer_id)
   FROM sales
   ORDER BY customer_id;
   ```

## Rules for Subqueries

- Subqueries must be enclosed within parentheses.
- A subquery can have only one column in the SELECT clause unless multiple columns are in the main query.
- An ORDER BY command cannot be used in a subquery.
- Subqueries that return more than one row can only be used with multiple value operators such as IN.
- The SELECT list cannot include references to BLOB, ARRAY, CLOB, or NCLOB.
- A subquery cannot be immediately enclosed in a set function.
- The BETWEEN operator cannot be used with a subquery, but it can be used within the subquery.

## Summary

Subqueries in SQL provide a flexible and powerful way to perform nested queries, allowing for complex data retrieval. Understanding their syntax and applications is crucial for advanced database querying and analysis.
