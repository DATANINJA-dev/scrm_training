<!-- # OUTER JOIN in SQL -->

## Introduction

OUTER JOIN in SQL is a type of join that is used to retrieve data from multiple tables in a database. It is a crucial aspect of SQL as it allows for the combination of data from different tables based on a related column between them. This lecture focuses on the concept of OUTER JOIN, specifically the FULL OUTER JOIN, and its application in SQL queries.

## Conceptual Explanation

Joins are fundamental in SQL for combining rows from two or more tables. The OUTER JOIN is unique because it can return all rows from both tables, even if the join condition is not met. This type of join is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to find records that have no match in another table.

### Types of Joins

- **INNER JOIN**: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
- **LEFT OUTER JOIN (LEFT JOIN)**: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table.
- **RIGHT OUTER JOIN (RIGHT JOIN)**: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table.
- **FULL OUTER JOIN (FULL JOIN)**: Combines the results of both left and right outer joins.
- **CROSS JOIN (CARTESIAN JOIN)**: Returns the Cartesian product of both tables.

## Syntax and Usage

The basic syntax for a FULL OUTER JOIN in SQL is as follows:

```sql
SELECT table1.column1, table2.column2...
FROM table1
FULL JOIN table2
ON table1.common_field = table2.common_field;
```

This syntax combines the data from two tables based on a common field, including records that do not have matching values in either table.

## Practical Examples

Consider two tables: `sales_2015` and `customer_20_60`. The following SQL query demonstrates how to use a FULL OUTER JOIN to combine data from these tables:

```sql
SELECT 
    a.order_line, 
    a.product_id,
    a.customer_id,
    a.sales,
    b.customer_name,
    b.age,
    b.customer_id
FROM sales_2015 AS a
FULL JOIN customer_20_60 AS b
ON a.customer_id = b.customer_id
ORDER BY a.customer_id, b.customer_id;
```

In this example, the query retrieves order lines, product IDs, customer IDs, sales figures, customer names, and ages from both tables, ordering them by customer ID.

## Summary

The FULL OUTER JOIN in SQL is a powerful tool for combining data from two tables, especially when you need to include rows that do not have corresponding matches in the other table. Understanding its syntax and application is essential for effective database management and data analysis.
