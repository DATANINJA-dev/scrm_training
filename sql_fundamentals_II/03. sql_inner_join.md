<!-- # INNER JOIN in SQL -->

## Introduction

INNER JOIN is a fundamental concept in SQL used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. This operation is critical in database management for querying complex data sets efficiently.

## Conceptual Explanation

INNER JOIN works by comparing each row in one table with every row in another table to find pairs of rows that satisfy a specified condition. When a match is found based on the join predicate, the column values from each matched pair of rows are combined into a result row. This process allows for effective data retrieval from multiple tables in a relational database.

## Syntax and Usage

The basic syntax for an INNER JOIN is as follows:

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

Here, `table1` and `table2` are the tables to be joined. The `ON` clause specifies the column based on which the join is performed.

## Practical Examples

Consider two tables: `sales_2015` and `customer_20_60`. To join these tables based on a common `customer_id` and retrieve relevant data, the query would be:

```sql
SELECT 
  a.order_line, 
  a.product_id, 
  a.customer_id, 
  a.sales, 
  b.customer_name, 
  b.age
FROM sales_2015 AS a
INNER JOIN customer_20_60 AS b
ON a.customer_id = b.customer_id
ORDER BY a.customer_id;
```

This query retrieves order details along with customer information where the customer IDs in both tables match.

## Summary

INNER JOIN in SQL is essential for combining data from multiple tables based on a related column. Understanding and effectively utilizing INNER JOIN is crucial for database querying and management, particularly in complex data environments.
