<!-- # SQL UNION Operator -->

## Introduction

The UNION operator in SQL is used to combine the result sets of two or more SELECT statements. It is particularly useful for consolidating results from multiple queries into a single result set. A key feature of UNION is that it automatically removes duplicate rows between the result sets.

## Conceptual Explanation

UNION is used to execute two or more SELECT statements and combine their results into a single result set. It only includes distinct values, effectively removing duplicates. This operation is useful when you need to aggregate data from different sources or tables but only want to include unique records.

## Syntax and Usage

The basic syntax for using the UNION operator in SQL is:

```sql
SELECT expression1, expression2, ... expression_n
FROM tables
[WHERE conditions]
UNION
SELECT expression1, expression2, ... expression_n
FROM tables
[WHERE conditions];
```

Each SELECT statement within the UNION must have the same number of fields with similar data types.

## Practical Examples

Consider two tables: `sales_2015` and `customer_20_60`. The following SQL query demonstrates the use of the UNION operator:

```sql
SELECT customer_id
FROM sales_2015
UNION
SELECT customer_id
FROM customer_20_60
ORDER BY customer_id;
```

In this example, the query retrieves unique customer IDs from both `sales_2015` and `customer_20_60` tables, ordering them by customer ID.

## Summary

The UNION operator in SQL is a powerful tool for combining data from multiple SELECT statements while ensuring that only unique records are included in the final result. Understanding its syntax and application is essential for effective data consolidation and analysis.
