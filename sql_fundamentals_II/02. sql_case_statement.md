<!-- # SQL CASE Statement -->

## Introduction

The CASE statement in SQL is a conditional expression, similar to if/else statements in programming languages. It allows for condition-based querying, making SQL queries more dynamic and versatile.

## Conceptual Explanation

The CASE statement provides a way to perform conditional logic directly within an SQL query. It evaluates conditions and returns a value when the first condition is met. If no conditions are met, it can return a default value (specified in the ELSE clause).

## Syntax and Usage

There are two forms of the CASE expression in SQL:

1. **Simple CASE expression**:
   ```sql
   CASE expression
   WHEN value THEN result
   [WHEN ...]
   [ELSE result]
   END
   ```

2. **Searched CASE expression**:
   ```sql
   CASE WHEN condition THEN result
   [WHEN ...]
   [ELSE result]
   END
   ```

## Practical Example

Consider the following SQL query using a CASE statement:

```sql
SELECT *,
CASE WHEN age < 30 THEN 'Young'
     WHEN age > 60 THEN 'Senior Citizen'
     ELSE 'Middle aged'
END AS Age_category
FROM customer;
```

In this example, the query classifies customers into categories based on their age. The CASE statement assigns a label to each age group.

## Summary

The CASE statement in SQL is a powerful tool for introducing conditional logic into SQL queries. It enhances the flexibility of data retrieval by allowing different outputs based on specific conditions.
