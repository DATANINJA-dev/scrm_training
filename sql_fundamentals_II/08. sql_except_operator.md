<!-- # SQL EXCEPT Operator -->

## Introduction

The EXCEPT operator in SQL is used for set operations. It allows you to return all rows from the first SELECT statement that are not present in the result set of the second SELECT statement. This operator is particularly useful for finding differences between two datasets.

## Conceptual Explanation

EXCEPT performs a set difference operation. It compares the result sets of two SELECT statements and returns rows from the first set that do not appear in the second set. This operation is useful in scenarios where you need to identify unique records in one dataset that are not found in another.

## Syntax and Usage

The basic syntax for using the EXCEPT operator in SQL is as follows:

```sql
SELECT expression1, expression2, ...
FROM tables
[WHERE conditions]
EXCEPT
SELECT expression1, expression2, ...
FROM tables
[WHERE conditions];
```

This syntax retrieves data based on the criteria specified in the SELECT statements and then excludes the rows from the second query from the result set of the first query.

## Practical Examples

Consider two tables: `sales_2015` and `customer_20_60`. The following SQL query demonstrates the use of the EXCEPT operator:

```sql
SELECT customer_id
FROM sales_2015
EXCEPT
SELECT customer_id
FROM customer_20_60
ORDER BY customer_id;
```

In this example, the query retrieves customer IDs from the `sales_2015` table that are not found in the `customer_20_60` table, ordering the result by customer ID.

## Summary

The EXCEPT operator in SQL is a valuable tool for comparing and contrasting datasets. It helps in identifying unique records in one dataset that do not exist in another, aiding in data analysis and database management.
