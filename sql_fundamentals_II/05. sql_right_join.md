<!-- # RIGHT JOIN in SQL -->

## Introduction

RIGHT JOIN, also known as RIGHT OUTER JOIN, is a SQL operation that combines rows from two tables. It is particularly used to return all rows from the right table, even if there are no matching entries in the left table, which is crucial in certain database querying scenarios.

## Conceptual Explanation

RIGHT JOIN is similar to LEFT JOIN, but it focuses on the right table. It retrieves all records from the right table, paired with the matched records from the left table. If there is no match, the left table will have NULL values. This join type is beneficial when you need to preserve all records from the right table in your result set.

## Syntax and Usage

The syntax for RIGHT JOIN is:

```sql
SELECT table1.column1, table2.column2...
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.common_field = table2.common_field;
```

In this structure, `table1` is the left table, and `table2` is the right table. The `ON` clause defines the condition for the join.

## Practical Examples

For instance, if we have two tables: `sales_2015` and `customer_20_60`, and we want to include all customers along with any sales records, the query would be:

```sql
SELECT 
  a.order_line, 
  a.product_id, 
  a.customer_id, 
  a.sales, 
  b.customer_name, 
  b.age
FROM sales_2015 AS a
RIGHT JOIN customer_20_60 AS b
ON a.customer_id = b.customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
```

This ensures every customer is included in the result, even if they don't have corresponding sales records.

## Summary

RIGHT JOIN in SQL is essential when the goal is to include every row from the right table in a query, regardless of matching rows in the left table. It's a powerful tool for specific data retrieval needs in database management.
